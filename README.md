## MiddCourses Presentation

### Outline

- Brief introduction
- Stats from the first semester
- Improvements over the summer
- How to help
- What will happen this semester

### Why not a speaker deck

This is way cooler and allows us to add interaction if we want. I'm not using
the software I wrote since it doesn't resize text to the screen or support
mobile well.
